                How Long Does Immunity Last After COVID-19? <br /> What We Know

                  For those who recover from COVID-19, immunity to the virus can
                  last at least 8 months and maybe longer, research shows.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Immunity can occur naturally after developing COVID-19 or from
                  getting the COVID-19 vaccination
                </li>
                <li>
                  Because the length of immunity after developing COVID-19 or
                  getting the vaccine is unknown, practicing physical or social
                  distancing and wearing a mask need to continue to stop the
                  spread.

                Whether you’ve recovered from COVID-19, received the vaccine, or
                neither, understanding immunity and how long it lasts can help
                give you important insight into how you can interact safely with
                others during the pandemic. First, it helps to know what
                immunity means. There are two types of immunity: natural and
                vaccine-induced
              </p>

              <h4>How natural immunity works after COVID-19 develops</h4>
              <p>
                After a person acquires a virus, the immune system retains a
                memory of it. Immune cells and proteins that circulate in the
                body can recognize and kill the pathogen if it’s encountered
                again, protecting against disease and reducing illness severity.
