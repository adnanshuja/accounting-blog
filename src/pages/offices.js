                      As a business owner, managing and keeping on top of your
                      finances can often feel overwhelming. But, investing in
                      your small business from the get-go will only make life
                      easier when you start to grow.

                    <p>
                      At Treetops, we specialise in small business accounting,
                      and can help individuals, sole traders and start-ups to

                      Anyone who has tried completing a personal tax return
                      knows just how exasperating it can be, especially if you
                      are selfemployed, a sole-trader, a landlord or have
                      received income from abroad, savings, investments and

                    <p>
                      At Treetops we regularly file hundreds of tax returns each
                      year on behalf of our clients up and down the country
                      including in Newbury – so we are well versed in liaising
                      with HRMC. Afterall why spend a tedious amount of time
                      tackling your taxes when you can leave it to the

                    <p>
                      If you are considering selling, gifting or handing down
                      personal assets such as stocks, shares, bonds or even part
                      or all of your business, it is important to seek some tax

                    <p>
                      Capital gains tax can be complex and getting it wrong
                      could prove costly, causing significant increases to your
                      tax bill. At Treetops Chartered Accounting we can help to
                      mitigate or reduce potential tax liabilities as well as
                      assist in claiming valuable tax reliefs and exemptions.

                    <p>
                      Keeping accurate, up to date records is important for any
                      business, but every year VAT regulations become more
                      complicated. And with the impact of both Brexit and
                      government initiatives to Make Tax Digital, keeping up to
                      date with your VAT submissions can often feel all
                      consuming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Failure to identify and apply the correct rates of VAT can
                      result in hefty fines and outstanding HMRC bills and have
                      the potential to be the downfall for any business. So, if
                      you prefer to concentrate on the money making side of
                      thing, why not outsource your accounting needs to Treetops

                      There was a time when being a landlord seemed like the
                      quickest route to living the high life. However, recent
                      tax changes and an increase in stamp duty in the last few
                      years have made it trickier to turn a profit on a buy to
                      let property.

                    <p>
                      If you are a landlord in the Newbury area, it is more
                      important than ever that you look after your financial
                      responsibilities in order to achieve the maximum amount of
                      passive rent and investment growth.

                      As a contractor you are legally obliged to register for
                      the scheme, but subcontractors are free to make their own
                      decision. Tax deductions for those not registered,
                      however, are likely to be taken at a higher rate.

                      Whilst the CIS aims at minimising tax evasion within the
                      construction industry, the objective of the taxpayer is to
                      pay as little as legally permitted. Tax calculation and
                      CIS tax assessments are incredibly complex and often
                      require expert assistance in order to ensure that you are
                      not hampered with heavy taxation. If you need help
                      registering, managing and organising your CIS accounts,
                      then contact Treetops today.

                    <p>
                      As an employer, you have a legal duty to automatically
                      enrol your staff into a workplace pension if they meet the
                      specified criteria and contribute to their payments.

                    <p>
                      As a business owner, employee pension schemes are often
                      considered an extra burden to both your time and your
                      budget and the new regulations are far from
                      straightforward. This is where Treetops Chartered
                      Accountants can help.

                      When it comes to Auto-Enrolment we can assist you to
                      fulfil your employer duties and explain the varying rates
                      of deductions and contributions as well as exemptions to
                      the rule. We will help you to identify which of your staff
                      must be enrolled into the workplace pension and support
                      you in setting up monthly pension contributions from you
                      and your employees.
